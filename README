Leap Motion GTA V Controller (on the PS3)
-----------------------------------------

This is a proof of concept to control the GTA V game on a PS3 by using
a Leap Motion device.

The project gets the hand gestures from the Leap Motion and simulates key
combos which should be detected by GIMX (which allows to control a PS3 from
a PC) and simulate the corresponding actions on the PS3.

----------
How to Use
----------

Assuming you have all that is needed for the Leap device and the GIMX to
be used...

Run the leapd daemon, then run leap-gnome-controller.py:
$ leapd &
$ ./leap-gta5-controller.py

Run the GIMX emuclient with the provided configuration file:
$ ./emuclient --config gta-v-leap-config.xml

Gestures

There are gestures not only to control the character in GTA V but also
to navigate the PS3 menu and choose the game (or use the confirm action).
